Nostalgia is delicate but potent. From the Greek Nostalgia means a pain from an old wound. Its a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This App is a Time Machine. It goes backwards and forwards. Taking us to a place where we ache to go again. 

Nostalgia is an iOS 10 / Swift 3 App that uses the Photo Library and access to the microphone to make a voice recording associated with a photo and transcribe that memory to text to enable playback and searching both in app and in Spotlight to search your photo library.
